<h3>Code Explanation</h3>
The code begins with the inclusion of the `stdio.h` header file that contains the standard input/output functions in C.

The `main()` function is then defined. It returns an integer value to the operating system upon completion.

Four variables are declared with their initial values assigned. `age` is an integer variable with an initial value of `25`, `num` is a `float` variable with an initial value of `32.4`, `salary` is a double variable with an initial value of `539.0`, and `alphabet` is a character variable with an initial value of `'c'`.

The `age` variable is reassigned a new value of `31`.

A new `float` variable `num2` is declared.

The value stored in `num` is assigned to `num2`.

Finally, the values of the variables are printed using their respective format specifiers using the `printf()` function. Each variable is printed on a new line using `\n`.

The `main()` function returns `0` to the operating system to indicate successful completion of the program.
